Much of my work in cancer has focused on cancer symptoms and distress that comes from it. In particular, I've had an interest in pain for many years. I also recently collaborated with colleagues on a meta-analysis of the relationship between cervical cancer and IUD use. I've used a variety of techniques for these studies, including multi-level models, Bayesian techniques, and predictive modeling.
