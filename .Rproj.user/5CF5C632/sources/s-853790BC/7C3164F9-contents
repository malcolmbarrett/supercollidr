Follow-up care is an important issue in long-term eye and vision health. Previous work on the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study and the Chinese American Eye Study have addressed this issue from a cross-sectional perspective, but the African American Eye Disease study is the first of these three to collect data on follow-up care within the first year of the study. In addition to the Health Behavior Model, we're applying a novel model based on psychosocial factors using structural equation modeling, as well as machine learning techniques.
