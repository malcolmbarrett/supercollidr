I went into epidemiology because I saw how many talented clinicians there were in community health that needed help with analysis. When the people we serve donate their time and data, quality study design and analysis is the best way to make good on our promises.

I can help with:

- Study design
- Analysis plans
- Coding and modeling
- Instruction in R and other statistical tools
- Data visualization
