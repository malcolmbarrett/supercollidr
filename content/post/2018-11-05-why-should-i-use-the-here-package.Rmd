```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


## TL;DR: Why should I use `here`?

* The `here` package makes it easier to use sub-directories within projects
* It's robust to other ways people open and run your code
* Like its base R cousin, `file.path()`, it writes paths safely across operating systems

Like a lot of people, when I learned R, I was taught to put `setwd()` and `rm(list = ls())` at the beginning of scripts. Geting rid of any leftovers in the environment and setting the working directory so I can use relative paths made sense to me. It seemed like good practice! But `setwd()` and `rm(list = ls())` are problematic. `rm()` doesn't actually give you a clean R session; it doesn't, for instance, detach packages. `setwd()`, meanwhile, is completely dependent on the way you organize your files. If you set a working directory that is an absolute path on your computer, it will only run for someone else if they rewrite the absolute path to where it is on *their* computer. 

Last year, Jenny Bryan shared some slides from a talk on this subject. I'll let them speak for themselves:

> *If the first line of your R script is*

> `setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")`
> 
> *I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE* ðŸ”¥.

> *If the first line of your R script is*

If you haven't read [her write-up on what the issues and solutions are](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/), you should. Here's the basic idea:

- Use Rstudio projects. They set up a local working directory in a fresh R session, which makes it much easier for someone else to open
- Use `here()` from the `here` package to write file paths

[Setting up a project is easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etkSsF6r2iU)[^1]. Projects can handle both of the problems `setwd()` and `rm(list = ls())` are trying to solve for you. You can [set it so you have a fresh R session when opening a project](https://community.rstudio.com/t/first-line-of-every-r-script/799/11) (either locally in the project or globally in Rstudio). Additionaly, when you're in a project, you don't need to set your working directory. The working directory is just wherever the project is.

So, it may not be obvious: what's the benefit of using the `here` package if projects solve both those problems?

# What's under here?

It may seem like `here` is just pasting paths together for you, but let's look at what it's actually doing. The `here` package is essentially a wrapper for the `rprojroot` package. `rprojroot` is a powerful tool for working with project directories, but `here` offers a simpler set of functions that take care of its main purpose: detecting the root directory and working with paths within it in a platform-independent way. 

If you use `here()`, it will tell you your project root directory, which will look something like this.

```{r here, eval=FALSE}
library(here)
here()
```

```{r here_results, eval=FALSE}
## here() starts at /Users/malcolmbarrett/folders/to/directory/
## [1] "/Users/malcolmbarrett/folders/to/directory/"
```

Essentially, `here()` is looking around for a few things that signify a root directory, like a `.Rproj` project file. `here` also has a function, `set_here()`, that will tag a directory as root using a `.here` file, even if it's not a project. In fact, `.here` files take priority, then `.Rproj` files, followed by several other file formats (see the documentation at `?here`). The last resort is the working directory. If you're not sure why `here` is picking a root directory, you can ask it to explain itself using `dr_here()`

```{r here_dir, eval=FALSE}
dr_here()
```

```{r here_dir_results, eval=FALSE}
## here() starts at /Users/malcolmbarrett/folders/to/directory/, because it contains a file matching `[.]Rproj$` with contents matching `^Version: ` in the first line
```

`here()` also works a lot like `file.path()` in that it will create a platform-independent path for you (e.g. it will work on Windows and Mac alike). On my Mac, it looks something like this:

```{r here_path, eval=FALSE}
here("figure", "figure.png")
```

```{r here_path_results, eval=FALSE}
## [1] "/Users/malcolmbarrett/folders/to/directory/figure/figure.png"
```

## I have a project. Why not just use relative paths?

I already touched on one reason to avoid writing paths yourself: the rules aren't necessarily the same between operating systems. You could, of course, use `file.path()` from base R, which safely creates a relative path for you.

```{r file_path, eval=FALSE}
file.path("figure", "figure.png")
```

```{r file_path_results, eval=FALSE}
## [1] "figure/figure.png"
```

But `here` has some added benefits: it makes it easier to manage subdirectories, and it makes your code more robust outside of projects. [As an example, I've set up an R project on my GitHub](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/here_here) that has a file directory like this:

```{r projdir, eval=FALSE}
here_here
|--data
    |--mtcars.csv
|--figs
    |--mpg_hp.png
|--rmd
    |--01_read_data.Rmd
    |--01_read_data.pdf
|--scripts
    |--read_data.R
|--here_here.Rproj
```

In `rmd/01_read_data.Rmd`, I try to call the data using a relative path from the root directory, but Rmarkdown sets a local working directory, so it fails: 

```{r fail, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("data/mtcars.csv")
```

```{r fail_results, eval=FALSE} 
## Error: 'data/mtcars.csv' does not exist in current working directory
```

I can solve this with some of the usual wonky backtracking, e.g. `../data/mtcars.csv`, but `here()` will take care if it for me by finding the project directory:

```{r herehere, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(here("data", "mtcars.csv"))
```

```{r herehere_results, echo = FALSE}
tibble::as_tibble(mtcars)
```

It works with no trouble. Likewise, saving output to other sub-directories is no issue:

```{r makee_ggplot}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp)) + geom_point()
```

```{r save_ggplot, eval = FALSE}
ggsave(here("figs", "mpg_hp.png"))
```

Which puts it in the `figs` folder despite being called from the `rmd` folder.

```{r projdir_fig, eval=FALSE}
|--figs
    |--mpg_hp.png
```

This is nice, as well, because if I move a file, I don't need to change the relative directory: it works from the root up. 

Another benefit is that, if I open any of these files outside of an Rstudio project, they will still run. For Rmarkdown files, using a relative path may be fine because it sets a local working directory when running, but `.R` files don't. If you open `scripts/read_data.R` in a different Rstudio session, for instance, the relative path fails, but `here()` still works fine. That's because it knows where the right directory is based on the `.Rproj` file.

Likewise, if you or someone else sets a working directory within your project, `here` will still work correctly because project directories take precedence. If you need to manually change it for some reason, it's better in this case to use `set_here()`.

## More than a path paster

`here` is one of the many tools in our toolkit for addressing reproducibility. Because it's designed to work with Rstudio projects, it's a natural tool to use within them. `here` is also robust to other ways people run your code. If that doesn't convince you, you can at least sleep soundly knowing that your computer will live another day.
