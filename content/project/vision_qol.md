Vision loss affects everyday life. Much of my work is on clarifying that effect, particularly between visual acuity and vision-related quality of life (VRQOL). Additionally, I'm currently working on several projects that contribute to the psychometric validity of popular scales for measuring VRQOL. This work is based on data from three large, population-based cohorts in Southern California: The Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, the Chinese American Eye Study, and the African American Eye Study. In addition to classical psychometric techniques, I also apply item response theory and other latent variable models to improve the accuracy of these measures.
